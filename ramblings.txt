only transmit files when they are needing to be opened, as they need to be opened,
  and only the parts of the file that need to be rendered

detect changes to files on disk using mtime
  and auto-sync those to the group

detect an out-of-sync state (what is hash of chars on line RAND characters RANDx - RANDY?) if its not the same then resend the document

buffer is closely tied to the view
  it only fetches enough bytes to fill the view
it grabs chunks equal to the current view's line in bytes

buffer is aware of how many views are using it
  before it seeks the file for more data,
  it determines which stripes are being used across all views
  it considers overlapping views
  and only fetches each line it needs once, in order from first byte to last byte in file
  and and when it fetches an area of the buffer that is overlapping in the view render
  it updates both views not one then again for the other

for my collaborative mode,
the guests will not receive mirror copies of the entire directory
the host will share the directory skeleton for the current directory
  and recursively but only upon a watch request
    watchers will receive push notification from the host (e.g. file added or removed under watchdir)

any file a client requests to open, the client, and all other clients will be aware of
  client will request the file from host
  host will broadcast to other clients that the client has opened the file
  and when it has closed the file

host will spoon-feed data to the clients like a buffer would
  so the clients only get the data they need to look at that moment

also, diffs are only broadcasted within the context of the all clients collective views, as well

if a file changes on the host system
  then we only broadcast that change if it is within the overlapped views of clients

this is very similar to how ssh vim tmux session would go, except we now have multiple cursors

cursor position updates will be notified (client->host) and rebroadcasted (others) with a throttle
but diffs will not be based on cursor position and exact keypress matches
  they will be actual patch diffs in a minimalist format

and what about binary files?
  these will not attempt to be diffed
  on modification, the latest (mtime) copy overrides everyone else's
    (clients will need to have a filesystem mtime watch too)
    the process for updating a binary file as a client would be:
      connect
      right-click > download the file or folder
      modify the file locally
      mtime inotify triggers guests to receive the bin file as well
      any new files created (atime) get auto-shared to the host
      client can be asked to resolve merge conflicts

its basically like a rapid git session

except i don't like all the assumptions made above re. bin files
  i think if the client wants to share a new file, it should be explicit, at least for now
    and let's see if it becomes a hassle
  or if a client wants to modify an existing binfile, it should also be explicit
    because in reality these will change a lot (e.g. during a photoshop editing session)
    and we really only care about the final result
    and most likely the group will want to talk it over and approve it before accepting it anyway

it would be cool if it had git support so that team commits could be saved with attribution for the authors involved when the commit was made
  and so the commits only happened on the host side
  same with pushes

NO that silly git diff is not applicable; it doesn't resolve changes on the same line
  so i need my own
  i think instead i will just translate the cursor/block edit operations to binary opcodes

  basically whatever you can do with a block, there's an opcode for that
    so shift selection one character right, shift selection one character left (unlikely use case)
    duplicate selection up/down
    delete selection
    insert before selection
    insert after selection
    move selection up/down
    backspace/delete x characters
    insert "literal" characters; assume we are working on an ascii file always
      pretty confident that's a safe assumption; collaborative editing binary files
      will have their own app and experience
    move cursor absolute x, y or relative -x, -y


when syncing hydrabuffers / views
  clients will write changes to disk, without filler
  as the view scrolls up/down the file will be prepended/appended
  until the file is complete

  if a user changes a file outside of nvim which they don't have a complete dataset for
   hmm

  ok getting too fancy here / prematurely optimizing / overengineering
  let's K.I.S.S.

  we'll transfer the whole ascii file to clients as they request to view it
  and then we'll work to keep it in sync from there
  its really not that much data to transfer

  except am i solving anything the other way around?
  a lot of times sync errors happen while users are editing in the areas
  we aren't currently watching for changes in

  i kind of like my ssh-vim-like approach

  ok so in that vain, the client does not buffer or store ANY data locally
  this way it cannot possibly go out of sync
  if it does, they just close/reopen the file to get back in sync
  sync will happen on a per-view basis

  same as if you opened a file and someone changed it while you were reading it

  this is also good because it functionally reinforces the idea of
  requiring clients to check-in new files or binary file changes
  by issuing special commands to have them imported to the host

  and then with that i can refuse to render binary files altogether
  just display an error like 'binary files unsupported; utf8 text only'

  so if someone wanted to edit a binary file in this flow, they would
  have to issue a special command to fetch the binfile
  then edit it locally
  then issue a special command to upload the binfile
  thus greatly reducing incidental sync errors
  and unnecessary data transfer






for a view statusbar just show:

relative path, bold filename
dont show line endings like 'unix | mac | win' thats pointless
instead highlight whitespace aggressively and with favoritism for unix
show percentage of file remaining
and cursor x:y pos


show treeview directory structure
  i'll have to implement this too because it needs remote support

the modes i'll implement will be:
  NORMAL except i'll call it COMBO
  INSERT except i'll call it NORMAL
  REPLACE i'll keep this the same
  V-LINE except i'll call it LINE-BLOCK
  V-BLOCK exept i'll call it BLOCK



treat views like a tiling window manager
create a Tab object like tmux-style tabs
  tabs will have user's names in collab mode

so it starts with one tab and one view
you can never have fewer than one view open
if you do its just resetting the file to an untitled in-memory buffer

when you add another view
  you can only do so by using a specific key combination / cmd
  to indicate a vsplit or hsplit or new tab

so when this happens, the default is to divide the tab 50/50
then the user can click and drag to resize from there

a view can never be less than 1 char high
and 1 char wide;
  for every line that isnt wrapped but is cutoff by a short viewport, a > is ending that line

opening more than one tab creates a 1char high tabbar at top of the screen



i may split View into ReadOnlyView extended by EditableView


HydraBuffer doesn't need to know about cursors
the view is always the one i keep landing in
its the one that colors the cursor
and shows it moving around the view
it has really nothing to do with the buffer
if a cursor moves off of a view, does it matter? (if a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound?)
no.




so there's a difference between a stream and a buffer here
the host is going to need to open a buffer
this also means that the entire file that is being edited needs to
be able to fit within the available ram memory
if we are going to save it back to the disk whole again
this is all a limitation of not being able to write in the middle of a file
hmm
i mean technically that's difficult because if anyone could do that
without a lock on the file
then you'd never know where you last left off
in order to insert your changes
plus even if a fancy filesystem supported this
you'd still have to implement your own layer on top of that
like a .vdi or .vmdk file
to make it fully compatible with other filesystems e.g., windows, sftp, nfs, etc.

the traditional options i have at my disposal are: writeFile (total replacement) and appendFile (write to end only)

so i can only use writeFile()
which means i have to pass the entire file
which means the entire file must fit in memory
which means buffering only the maximum rendered by the views in memory is pointless

well unless i get really creative with diffs
for example, if while using a readStream, i notate the offset location
and i assume that the file had a lock on it (could make my own .*.lck files)
then i would never need the whole file in memory
i could just replay chunks from the original file up to the point of my stream offset location
then write my modified contents
and write chunks of all this to a temporary file on disk (/tmp/nvi-filename.tmp)
and then mv the new file over the top of the old

i could get even more crafty and only store in-memory my changes and the location
that they occurred at
and just keep those in-memory until a save action is requested
then do the above replay-and-merge flushing-chunks-to-tmp-disk strategy

this way we can collaborate on huge text files, if we want, too
but on average it will reduce the amount of data needing to be thrown around

so what format would my in-memory buffer take?
i could use the diff/patch format
and record line-by-line changes
except some really long lines could mess with us there

110,10,115:abcdefgh

bah, i'm making it too complicated. i can be a bad-ass later. its getting late.

so i'll just use buffers for now
and always assume that the file will fit in memory
and that transmitting a file-at-a-time from host to client is fast enough


add funny -- COMBO X10! --
counter to the statusbar as each combo is executed within a 1 sec delay

no matter where you are in vim, you should always see the current mode
in a reliable place, because modes are so fundamental to vi operation
my modes will be color coded like the vi powerline theme
they will always appear in the view statusbar
except for COMMAND mode which will appear in the statusbar
this will make it very obvious what is going on

additionally, my vim will begin the user in INSERT mode
except remember i'm calling it NORMAL mode
so that when they start out its most like what they might
be famliar with: notepad, and they hvae to hit ESC to get to
COMBO mode (what i call the vi NORMAL mode)

make it so all @w and @h are the outer dims
and any decorators like tabs, statusbars, etc. must fit inside that
and relative to their parent dims who controls them

instead of doing a layered TUI that redraws layers ontop of layers
if i need to get more efficient
i could make a pixel/char registry which is basically a matrix of function pointers
the first cell points to a function that controls its appearance
and subsequent cells point back to the id of the first cell of which they also belong
then i just loop through the cells to determine which functions need to execute to redraw
the screen

its important to differentiate between the Terminal.cursor (there is only one; used to draw the screen)
and the ViewCursor (there can be one or more per view; used by users to traverse a view)
additionally between a ViewCursor that is the currently possessed (uses Terminal.cursor)
and a ViewCursor that is not possessed (unfocused, or someone else's cursor; drawn manually)

fix the command line disappearing on resize
next time i implement bksp, del, etc. see if i can modularize the custom readline functionality i added to the command bar

de-duplicate information presented in vim statusbars;
  treat Window.status_bar as global log notifications like "read 144B, 23C, 104L in 0.23sec"
  treat View.status_bar as stateful mode and cursor position information

i'll improve on vim window management
when the terminal resizes, instead of remembering exact widths and collapsing containers on the right
i'll remember relative widths in percentages and try to retain the aspect ratio of each view
when the terminal resizes

display errors such as 'Not enough room' in the Window.status_bar
  support displaying errors in an obnoxious white-on-red color scheme

hmm it seems that cursors are slightly different than i thought

a cursor is logically part of the buffer
but it is rendered by a bufferview

in a buffer, some characters are untouchable
 like ^M
i should replace ^M with a colored \r or CR in my markup
these symbols have multiple characters, which register in the x,y coord system
 but the cursor can only touch the first char of them,a nd the rest it skips over
while delete and backspace take out the whole-symbol-at-a-time
so the buffer will track the x,y and the actual characters
meanwhile the cursor will check in a symbol registry on the buffer
and if its touching any symbol it will behave specially
the buffer is also where we will render whitespace chars
whitespace chars are symbols as defined above
whitespace symbols are configurable in json but mine will be default

a symbol is a string of chars which represent exactly one real buffer byte
